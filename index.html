        <h4>Intro</h4>
        <p>
            This webpage will show the inner working both of Leon Redžić and this webpage itself. The concept was inspired by a number of
            pages you can found trought the internet. This page extends on this idea by using latest css selectors and some new HTML 5 elements like
            article and section. The idea was to have sections describe the author, then articles to describe the author projects

            <p>
                Have built Wordpress themes from scratch and deployed all of that sites to WHM/Cpanel servers.
                Those site vary from custom Woocomerce sites to simple one pagers, and hybrid Vue.js Wordpress apps.
                Built upon the Wordpress API to extract data and use Wordpress as an API CMS. Some sites like
                <a href="http://profitability.neos.hr/">Neos profitability</a>, <a href="https://homecontrol.no/flow/">Homecontrol flow</a>,
                <a href="http://www.montelektro.hr/hr/">Montelektro</a> where there is a special user SLA portal in the back. Also Woocomerce sites like
                <a href="https://ljiljan-s.hr/">Ljiljan-s</a> website where a custom Woocomerce plugin was made to accomodate special request for prices of products and
                actions on those products.<br> Currently I maintain over 6 wordpress sites on a monthly basis.
                And numerous more where I did maintaince trough Upwork platform and favors to friends.

                connected to the cloud. The Ionic app has two encrypted connections. A Websocket one and an HTTP one. I have been involved with this app from the very start
                and was in charge of the first iOS realeases and store submissions. On the app side I do system preparation for all the other developers to work on. And
                maintaining the front End of the application to the standard. <br>
                I have worked on multiple Ionic apps such as <a href="http://www.divetheapp.com/">Dive the app</a> that is a multilanguage comic book reader and a dive log.<br>
                Rest of the work is on 4 similar apps.

            <p>
                Worked on a large scale Angular 2 application that we migrated trough the latest tree of angular releases with typescript support. This experience is 2+ years
                so I have been involved in a lot of issues in this aspect of development. With using and debuging all the aspects of Angular development.

            <h5>Vue.js</h5>
            <p>
                Built a large scale application that has a concept of gamification on watching learning videos. This application used the Wordpress as it's backend service.
                This project was only a preparation for another seperate Vue.js application built upon Firebase functions and Firebase database that has a concept of
                a quiz, where a large number of users answer questions and displayed their results in realtime. <br>
                Also I was involved in creating a slicing template for frontend developers.
